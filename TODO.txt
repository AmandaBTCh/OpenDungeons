BUGS:
*  fix keyboard repeat issue.
*  Fix crash on entering a nonexistant mesh to addclass after calling addcreature using this class.
*  Terminal commands with no arguments but spaces at the end, like 'host ', will not be recognized as valid commands.
*  Fix crash on loading a new map from the server, I think it has to do with getting peices of messages in a single packet.  This assumption may or may not be true, it may be that the RenderQueue is somehow processing the addDestination message before the createMesh message.
*  The GameMap::cutCorners() function sometimes causes creatures to walk through walls, this could be a problem with the lineOfSight function.



FEATURE ADDITIONS:
*  implement history on the terminal.
*  implement line editing on the terminal.
*  add help for "fps", "nearclip", "farclip".
*  when the terminal becomes active if a key is held down the keyup message gets caught by the terminal and the key is "stuck" down.
*  add a flyTo method to make the camera fly to a particular location (and orientation?).
*  Add a keyboard controls help message under "help keys".
*  Server needs to send the "turnsPerSecond" message as part of the initial client setup.
*  Store creature classes and class descriptions in maps rather than vectors to allow for faster lookups.


*  Fix the issue with Mouse move.
*  find out about separate subtraction and multiply issue in ExampleFrameLiyystener::mouseMoved(const OIS::MouseEvent &arg)


*  make camera center stay focused on the same point and rotate around it rather than rotating the camera around a fixed point.
*  add a disconnect command to stop the running client or server thread.
