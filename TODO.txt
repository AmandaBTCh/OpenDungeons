BUGS:
*  fix keyboard repeat issue.
*  Fix crash on entering a nonexistant mesh to addclass after calling addcreature using this class.
*  Terminal commands with no arguments but spaces at the end, like 'host ', will not be recognized as valid commands.
*  Fix crash on loading a new map from the server, I think it has to do with getting peices of messages in a single packet.  This assumption may or may not be true, it may be that the RenderQueue is somehow processing the addDestination message before the createMesh message.
*  The GameMap::cutCorners() function sometimes causes creatures to walk through walls, this could be a problem with the lineOfSight function.  Actually I think it has to do with Creature::PositionTile().
*  Solved? - I think the crash in root->startRendering possibly has to do with attatching things directly to the root scene node.
*  The client has code to handle when messages are split across packets, but the server does not.  This needs to be added.
*  when the terminal becomes active if a key is held down the keyup message gets caught by the terminal and the key is "stuck" down.
*  Client and server need to negiotiate and set a color for the newly connected client.



FEATURE ADDITIONS:
*  implement history on the terminal.
*  implement line editing on the terminal.
*  add help for "fps", "nearclip", "farclip".
*  add a flyTo method to make the camera fly to a particular location (and orientation?).
*  Add a keyboard controls help message under "help keys".
*  Server needs to send the "turnsPerSecond" message as part of the initial client setup.
*  Store creature classes and class descriptions in maps rather than vectors to allow for faster lookups.
*  Add play, pause, and single turn commands to the terminal to aid in AI debugging. 
*  Add a terminal command to set the number of chat messages and the time to display them for (both as one command maybe).
*  Overload the << operator on the Player class, do the same for all the others.


*  Fix the issue with Mouse move.
*  find out about separate subtraction and multiply issue in ExampleFrameLiyystener::mouseMoved(const OIS::MouseEvent &arg)


*  make camera center stay focused on the same point and rotate around it rather than rotating the camera around a fixed point.
*  add a disconnect command to stop the running client or server thread.
