You may need to custom build a version of CEGUI for your system which uses a different XML parsing engine than the one some prebuilt binaries use.  When you build CEGUI use these instructions (run from the directory where you unpacked the CEGUI source code):

./configure --with-default-xml-parser=TinyXMLParser
make
sudo make install


Once you have done that you can build and run the game by running (from the directory where this README file is):

make
./MapEditor
