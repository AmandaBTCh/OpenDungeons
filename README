--- Bugs: ---

You may need to custom build a version of CEGUI for your system which uses a different XML parsing engine than the one some prebuilt binaries use.  This is known to be a problem on Debian and Ubuntu systems.  When you build CEGUI use these instructions (run from the directory where you unpacked the CEGUI source code):


	./configure --with-default-xml-parser=TinyXMLParser
	make
	sudo make install


Once you have built and installed the CEGUI libraries, return to the OpenDungeons directory and run the following commands.


	make clean
	cmake .
	make
	./MapEditor


*  Once the game is loaded, clicking the mouse, before moving the mouse will produce a crash.

*  While the game is loading you must keep the mouse inside the game window.  When
the scene initializes if the mouse cursor is outside of the window it will
cause a crash.
