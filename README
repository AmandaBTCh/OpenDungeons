-- Coding Guideline ---
Before you start coding you should take a glimpse at our guideline
over at the wiki:
  https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/wiki/Code-Guidelines

It contains a rather deep introduction on how we name, indent, structure and
extend our code. It also has some performance optimisation tips.

--- Build Instructions ---
More detailed, and usually up to date build instructions can be found at:
  https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/wiki/Compile

To build the game run the following commands from the directory where this
README file is. You will need CMake for this (http://cmake.org/).

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -jX    // X is the number of CPU cores that you want to allocate
    ./opendungeons

To build the game, you will need to link against the following libraries:
*  OGRE SDK (1.9.x)
*  boost (same version as the one used by Ogre)
*  CEGUI SDK (0.8.x)
*  SFML (2.x)

Note that you need a compiler that supports reasonably well C++11 features.
* Linux: GCC 4.8+
* Windows: MSVS 2013 Express or MinGW 4.8+

On windows, make sure you have the MSVC corresponding SDK, or either compile from source.

Then, use CMake-Gui to generate project files for your IDE.

You can also have a look at our FAQ.txt file for more information.
