-- Coding Guideline ---
Before you start coding you should take a glimpse at our guideline over at the
wiki:
  http://opendungeons.sourceforge.net/index.php/Code_Style_Guidelines
It contains a rather deep introduction on how we name, indent, structure and
extend our code. It also has some performance optimisation tips.

--- Build Instructions ---
More detailed, and usually up to date build instructions can be found at:
http://opendungeons.sourceforge.net/index.php/Download

To build the game run the following commands from the directory where this
README file is. You will need CMake for this (http://cmake.org/).

	cmake.
	make
	./OpenDungeons.bin

To build on windows you will need to link against the following libraries:
*  OGRE SDK
*  OIS
*  CEGUI SDK
*  pthreads-win32
*  SFML

CMake also can generate project files for your preferred IDE (Visual Studio,
Eclipse, ...)
