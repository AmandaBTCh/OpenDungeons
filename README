--- Build Instructions ---
To build the game run the following commands from the directory where this README file is:

	cmake.
	make
	./MapEditor


For keyboard controls see:

http://andrewbuck.homelinux.org/wiki/Game_controls


To build on windows you will need to link against the following libraries:
*  DirectX SDK
*  OGRE SDK
*  OIS
*  CEGUI SDK
*  pthreads-win32

There is a makefile provided for the mingw compiler.  Since the library paths
depend on where you install them to, you may need to edit the makefile slightly
(start with the WINEDIR variable).  To build using mingw do the following

cp Makefile.mingw Makefile
make depend
make



--- Bugs: ---

You may need to custom build a version of CEGUI for your system which uses a different XML parsing engine than the one some prebuilt binaries use.  This is known to be a problem on Debian and Ubuntu systems.  When you build CEGUI use these instructions (run from the directory where you unpacked the CEGUI source code):


	./configure --with-default-xml-parser=TinyXMLParser
	make
	sudo make install


Once you have built and installed the CEGUI libraries, return to the OpenDungeons directory and run the following commands.


	make clean
	cmake .
	make
	./MapEditor


*  Once the game is loaded, clicking the mouse, before moving the mouse will produce a crash.

*  While the game is loading you must keep the mouse inside the game window.  When
the scene initializes if the mouse cursor is outside of the window it will
cause a crash.
